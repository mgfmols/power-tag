## Important to know
When playing the game, save data for the leaderboard is stored using **PlayerPrefs**, meaning data is stored in the Windows Registry.
When using Unity to open the project, any Play Mode data is stored at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Unity\UnityEditor\DefaultCompany\GameJam`
and when making a build, the data is stored at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\DefaultCompany\GameJam`.

## About the project
The current state of the project is a combination of a code revision and over 2 years of on-and-off development.

## My contribution
I am the sole contributer to this project, meaning I developed it completely myself. I developed the codebase, power-ups, game systems and leaderboard entirely myself.
